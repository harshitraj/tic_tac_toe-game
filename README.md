This game is developed using C++ code.
<br>
Here we have 3 main files: 
<br> 
(i) tic_tac_toe.cpp
(ii) tasks.json
(iii) launch.json
<br>
<br>
The tasks.json file is used to define tasks that can be run in the terminal, such as compiling code, running scripts, or executing commands. It is especially useful for automating build processes and other repetitive tasks.
<br>
The launch.json file is used to configure debugging settings for your project. It allows you to specify how the debugger should run your application, set breakpoints, and attach to running processes.
